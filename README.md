# Bidirectional-Geometric-Design-Platform
This package provides the design platform for the continuous and discrete surfaces within the restricted surface classes, promoting quality, safety, and efficient manufacturing and construction. Basic tools for geometric properties based on discrete differential geometry is also provided.
